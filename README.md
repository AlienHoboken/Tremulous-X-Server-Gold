X Server Golden
=======================

This repository contains the code for the golden edition of the X server gameplay mod.

This version of the mod was decommissioned in 2011 after years of active use, with many of its changes persisting in the next iteration of the mod.

Building
-----------------------
This version of the X gameplay mod is built normally.

Make sure that the `MAKE_GAME_QVM` flag is set in the Makefile before building.

As normal there are shell scripts for building on Windows and Mac OSX. Windows requires MingW be used.

Running
-----------------------
This version of the X QVM can be run without use of customized dedicated server code, so most any tremulous server will work.
